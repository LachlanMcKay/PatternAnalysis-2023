# Pattern Analysis
Pattern Analysis of various datasets by COMP3710 students at the University of Queensland.

We create pattern recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow (TF), PyTorch or JAX.

This library is created and maintained by The University of Queensland [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) students.

The library includes the following implemented in Tensorflow:
* fractals 
* recognition problems

In the recognition folder, you will find many recognition problems solved including:
* OASIS brain segmentation
* Classification
etc.

# Classification for Alzheimer's disease of the ADNI brain data

## Description of the algorithm


## Problem that this project solves
This project utilises a modified dataset sourced from [ADNI dataset for Alzheimer's disease]().This dataset contains two repositories which are AD(disease) and NC(normal) and each repositorycontains training and test repositories. This project aims to utilise the Vision Transformer to classify the health brain images and unhelath images.
