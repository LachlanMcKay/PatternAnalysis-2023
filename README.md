# Pattern Analysis
Pattern Analysis of various datasets by COMP3710 students at the University of Queensland.

We create pattern recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow (TF), PyTorch or JAX.

This library is created and maintained by The University of Queensland [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) students.

# Task Statement:

Classify Alzheimer’s disease (normal and AD) of the ADNI brain data (see Appendix for link) using one of the latest vision transformers such as the GFNet [1] set having a minimum accuracy of 0.8 on the test set.
