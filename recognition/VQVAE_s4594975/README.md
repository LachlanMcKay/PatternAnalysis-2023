# VQVAE and Pixel CNN - Generative Model of OASIS Dataset
AIM: The aim of this project is to develop a generative model for one of the specified medical imaging datasets (OASIS brain, ADNI brain, or OAI AKOA knee) using a VQVAE (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder) with a PixelCNN (Pixel Convolutional Neural Network) to produce "reasonably clear" medical images with a Structured Similarity Index (SSIM) score exceeding 0.6. The project involves leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to create high-quality, structured, and interpretable medical images, which can be invaluable for medical diagnosis, research, and analysis.


## OASIS DATASET

The OASIS dataset, which stands for "Open Access Series of Imaging Studies," is a collection of neuroimaging and clinical data designed for research in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. It is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and scientists interested in studying brain health, dementia, and related conditions.

Traning Images - 9,664 
Test Images - 544
Validation Images - 1120

## VQVAE
A VQVAE, or Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder, is a type of neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning and generative modeling. 


## PIXEL CNN
## DATASET - PREPROCESSING
Preprocessed dataset was used which contained train, test and validation images. The dataset was normalised to be in the range [-0.5 to 0.5]
