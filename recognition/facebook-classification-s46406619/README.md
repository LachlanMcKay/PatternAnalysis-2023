# Semi supervised node classification of the *Facebook Large Page-Page Network* dataset.

*Include a description of the algorithm and the problem that it solves
(approximately a paragraph), how it works in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation*

We use a multi-layer graph-covolutional network (GCN) to classify the Facebook Large Page-Page Network dataset. 

## Results

See below a graph of the model's training accuracy and loss over 100 epochs.
