## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Download Dependencies


3. Download ISIC datasets.  The dataset should be positioned in the same folder as the python codes under ISIC Folder. The images should be positioned under the ISIC Folder, ISIC-2017_Training_Data folder, and another ISIC-2017_Training_Data folder.

## Usage
Run the train.py to train the model and create a model.pth file. 

Using this file you can get the segmented images.


## Description

1. The readme file should contain a title, a description of the algorithm and the problem that it solves
(approximately a paragraph), how it works in a paragraph and a figure/visualisation.
