# Generative VQ-VAE + PixelCNN for the ADNI brain data set

## 0.0 Overview
My project implements a Vector-Quantised Variation Autoencoder [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) with a 
[PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759v3) prior for the purpose of generating fake samples based on the ADNI 
brain dataset. The PixelCNN can be utilised to generate randomised discrete representations from the latent spaced
learnt by the VQ-VAE, to consequently generate fake brain images once the reconstruction is decoded by the VQ-VAE. 

## 1.0 Algorithm Summary / Background

The purpose of this section is to provide brief background theory on the models used in my generative model. For more 
detailed description, see the original [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) and [PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759v3).
I also found Aleksa GordiÄ‡'s YoutTube video [VQ-VAEs: Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://youtu.be/VZFVUrYcig0?si=WxpLWRl29EnONKiI)
to be extremely helpful in building understanding of the VQ-VAE model. 
 

### 1.1 VQ-VAE
To motivate the idea of a VQ-VAE, let us first revisit the idea of traditional Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). A VAE made up of
a decoder and an encoder. The purpose of the decoder is to, given a series of inputs, learns the probability 
distribution over a reduced representation over the latent vector space, which act as a reduced representation of the model inputs.
The encoder then reconstructs the original image 

As outlined in Oord's, Vinyals', and Kavukcuoglu's paper [Neural Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937),
a VQ-VAE differs from a traditional VAE in two key ways. The encode network outputs discrete, as opposed to continuous, codes;
and the prior (in this implementation a PixelCNN) is learnt rather than static.
