Create a data loader:
    image_folder    references the folder containing the classes of images
    image_size      resize the images to this size
    batch_size      the number of images the data loader should batch

Notes: When training a progressive GAN, a dataloader is required for each
       progressive image size. As image size increases, the batch size must
       decrease to accommodate the increased memory requirements.
