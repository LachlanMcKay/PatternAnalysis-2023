## How It Works



![XYZNet Architecture](./images/xyznet_architecture.png)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4.0
- Scikit-Learn 0.24.1
- Matplotlib 3.3.4

## Reproducibility



## Example Inputs, Outputs, and Plots

### Inputs

- Input images should be in the JPEG format.
- Images should be preprocessed to have a resolution of 224x224 pixels and normalized.

### Outputs

- XYZNet provides probability scores for each disease category.
- A threshold of 0.5 is used to classify images into binary categories (e.g., 'Disease' or 'No Disease').

### Plots



## Pre-processing



## Data Split

We split our dataset into the following proportions:
- 70% for training
- 15% for validation
- 15% for testing
