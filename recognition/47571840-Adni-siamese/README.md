# Classifier based on Siamese Network to Classify Alzheimer's Disease on ADNI Dataset

This repository implements a Siamese Network that will be trained to generate embeddings of  images of the ADNI dataset. A classifier (fully connected layers) will be added on top of the trained Siamese Network to classify Alzhemier's Disease on the dataset.

## General Overview of the Siamese Network
A Siamese Neural Network or twin neural network is an architecture that is made to differentiate between two inputs. It consists of two sub-networks that share the same weights and parameters. Each sub-network accept individual inputs, or in this case images, and produce feature vectors or embeddings. The euclidiean distance between the embeddings of both sub-networks are then calculated to determine the similarity between the inputs.
