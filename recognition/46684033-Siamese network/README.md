# COMP3710 Project Siamese Network on ADNI(46684033)
## Project aim:
Create a classifier based on Siamese network to classify either Alzheimer’s disease (normal and AD)
of the ADNI brain data set, while having an accuracy of around 0.8 on the test set

## Siamese Network
A Siamese neural network is a neural network that uses the
same weights while working in tandem on two different
input vectors to compute comparable output vectors[1].

*Example for a siamese network*[2]

Siamese neural network has different applications, one of the prevalent usage is matching the inputs to a vector space.
This enables metric learning and can be used to identify inputs' similarity. In this project, the inputs are brain images either with 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Cognitive Normal (CN) from the __ADNI__ dataset. A classifier is built based on the Siamese neural 
network
