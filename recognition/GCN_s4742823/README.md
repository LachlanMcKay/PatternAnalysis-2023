# Semi-supervised multi-class node classification via GCN
This Graph Convolutional Model is used to perform semi-supervised multi-class node classification. The nodes in question are Facebook pages, the edges are mutual likes between these pages and the features are descriptions of the pages created by their owners. The classes are politicians, governmental organisations, television shows and companies.

This algorithm uses a pre-processed dataset where features are in the form of 128 dim vectors. This was provied by the University of Queensland.
