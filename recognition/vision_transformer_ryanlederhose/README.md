# Classifying Alzheimer's Disease Using a Visual Transformer
The aim of this project is to classify Alzheimer's disease of the ADNI brain dataset using a visual transformer (ViT). The ADNI brain dataset is composed of two classes - AD meaning Alzheimer's disease, and NC meaning Normal Cognitive. The goal is to perform classification with a minimum accuracy on the test dataset of 0.8.
