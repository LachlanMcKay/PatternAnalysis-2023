# Siamese Network Classifier of the ADNI Brain Data Set

## Background
### Problem Description
This is a binary classification problem for the ADNI brain data set, with the labels being Cognitive Normal (CN) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A siamese neural network is employed for one-shot learning, which can make predictions given only a single example for each new class.
### Dataset: ADNI

### Siamese Network
