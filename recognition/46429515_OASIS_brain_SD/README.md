#OASIS brain dataset - Stable Diffusion Task


##Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a type of diffusion model that works in a two step process

that uses a technique similar to how a generative model would work. The diffusion

model operates by gradually adding noise to an input image in a forward process

and then retrieves the original image by denoising (backwards process).
