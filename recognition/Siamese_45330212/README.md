# Siamese Network Classifier based on ResNet-18
## Description
This Siamese Network-based classifier is designed for image similarity tasks. Leveraging a ResNet-18 architecture for feature extraction on the ADNI dataset for Alzheimerâ€™s disease, the classifier produces embeddings for a pair of these images, which are then fed into a simple binary classifier. This model can be particularly useful in tasks where the goal is to determine if two images belong to the same class.

## How it Works
The Siamese Network consists of two identical sub-networks that process two different images in parallel. The sub-networks are based on the ResNet-18 architecture and produce high-dimensional embeddings for the images. These embeddings are then compared and classified by a subsequent binary classifier to indicate if the images are similar or dissimilar.

## Data Preprocessing
The images are converted to the RGB space and normalized using a calculated set of mean and standard deviation values. The data is transformed into tensors using PyTorch's transforms library.

### Data Splits
The dataset is divided into 70% training and 30% testing sets. This split ensures that the model is trained on a diverse set of data and generalizes well to unseen data.
