The Siamese Neural Network is a powerful deep learning architecture used for various tasks, including image classification and similarity measurement. In this project, we have developed a Siamese Network to classify medical images into two classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC). The network is trained to distinguish between these two classes, and the project is divided into three main components: dataset preparation, neural network architecture, training, and prediction.
