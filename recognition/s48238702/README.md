## üßê Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The Siamese Neural Network is a powerful deep learning architecture used for various tasks, including image classification and similarity measurement. In this project, we have developed a Siamese Network to classify medical images into two classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC). The network is trained to distinguish between these two classes, and the project is divided into three main components: dataset preparation, neural network architecture, training, and prediction.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Code Overview <a name = "code_overview"></a>

<ol>
<b><li>Dataset Preparation</li></b>
<p>In the dataset preparation phase (<b>dataset.py</b>), we organize the medical image data into a format suitable for training and evaluating the Siamese Network. The key components include:

-	<b>Dataset Classes:</b> Two custom dataset classes, <b>SiameseDataset</b>, are defined for training and testing datasets.
-	<b>Data Loading:</b> The code loads medical image data from the specified directories. The dataset is organized into training and testing sets for AD and NC images.
-	<b>Image Preprocessing:</b> The loaded images are processed to ensure consistency in terms of size, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
</p>
<b><li>Neural Network Architecture</li></b>
<p>The heart of the project is the Siamese Neural Network (<b>modules.py</b>). The network architecture is structured as follows:

-	<b>CNN Architecture:</b> The network consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process the input images. It includes two convolutional layers with max pooling to extract relevant features.
-	<b>Fully Connected (FC) Layers:</b> The output from the CNN is passed through fully connected layers for classification.
-	<b>Two Outputs:</b> The network produces two output vectors, one for each input image in a pair, which are used for comparison during training.
-	<b>Contrastive Loss:</b> A custom loss function, called Contrastive Loss, is employed to train the network. It encourages the network to minimize the distance between similar image pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs.
</p>
<b><li>Training the Siamese Network</li></b>
<p>The training phase is performed in the train.py script. The key steps are as follows:

-	<b>Data Loading:</b> The training data is loaded using the load_siamese_data function, and a Siamese Network model is created.
-	<b>Device Selection:</b> The code checks for GPU availability and moves the model to the GPU for accelerated training.
-	<b>Training Loop:</b> The model undergoes training for a predetermined number of epochs. During training, the Siamese Network learns to distinguish between AD and NC images.
-	<b>Model Saving:</b> After training, the model is saved to a file (<b>SNN.pth</b>), allowing for future use.
-	<b>Loss Plotting:</b> A plot of training loss is generated to visualize the training progress.
</p>
<b><li>Making Predictions</li></b>
<p>The prediction phase is executed using the <b>predict.py</b> script. The main components of this phase include:

-	<b>Model Loading:</b> The trained Siamese Network model is loaded from the saved file.
-	<b>Device Selection:</b> Like the training phase, the code determines the device for execution (GPU or CPU).
-	<b>Predictions:</b> The model is used to make predictions on test data, determining whether an image is more likely to be AD or NC.
-	<b>Output Display:</b> Predictions are displayed for each sample, allowing an assessment of the model's performance.
