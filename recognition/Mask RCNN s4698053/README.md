# Mask RCNN on the ISIC 2017/8 data set

ISIC 2017/8 is a data set containing many images of skin with different types of lesions. They are masked with a binary mask. There is over 2000 labelled images in this dataset. This repo will attempt to detect these using machine learning, specially the Mask RCNN model.


The dataset has two classes and ignores masks when neither are found
