# TODO:
- Make code right (Time, Plots, Different Model, Model Save), Meta Learning?
- Graph Everything (Batch Norm, Train Test)
- Validation Set (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/training-neural-networks-with-validation-using-pytorch/)

- Regularization (Dropouts), Normalization
- Weights and Biases (Google)
- No model files in git but save it and datafiles
- 20 marks algo - solve problem, design, comment
